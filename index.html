            <h1>EMIYA KIRITSUGU</h1>
            <h2>(fate zero/stay night)</h2>
            <p>emiya kiritugu is the Master of Saber in the Fourth Holy Grail War of Fate/Zero. 
              He is the husband of Irisviel von Einzbern, the father of Illyasviel von Einzbern, 
              and the adoptive father of Shirou Emiya. <br> 
              He is the main protagonist of Fate/Zero and has a minor role in Fate/stay night. 
              He was a freelancer and notoriously known as the Magus Killer.
              In his youth, he wished to be a Hero of Justice and protect the weak.
              In order to pursue his dream, he attempts to distance himself from his emotions, 
              acting as the "machine that is Emiya Kiritsugu." <br>
              He has managed to become completely devoted to any duty without showing any 
              emotional wavering, though he is prone to occasionally fall into moments of extreme 
              emotion and despair. <br>
              Overall, while Kiritsugu is a ruthless, conflicted, calculating, stoic, and cold-blooded 
              killer who has committed some villainous acts to achieve his goals, he is idealistic 
              and has good intentions which makes him mostly an anti-hero. </p>

             <h1>ASSASSIN’S</h1>
             <h2>(FATE GRAND ORDER)</h2>
             <p>Assassin's True Name is EMIYA, Emiya Kiritsugu An assassin 
              who was incarnated as an agent of the Counter Force. 
              Originally, he was not a Heroic Spirit. Although he was an 
              individual who murdered many people as an assassin, 
              his existence has not been engraved in the Throne of Heroes.
              EMIYA has little emotions, an authentic battle machine. 
              He kills his targets promptly, without hesitation, and without 
              losing his way. <br> His personality is closer to his adolscent years; 
              his way of being is the adolscent Emiya Kiritsugu himself.
              Speaking of that again, his spirit is close to the time immediately 
              following him having personally killed his mentor Natalia Kaminski 
              as the "Magus Killer". <br>
              Consequentially, his heart of steel remained as steel, his emotions 
              eventually withering away completely. </p>
